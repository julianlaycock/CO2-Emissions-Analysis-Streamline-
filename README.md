# CO2-Emissions-Analysis-Streamline
## Web app

This repository also includes a simple interactive web app built with Streamlit.

To run it locally:

```bash
pip install streamlit
streamlit run app.py

The app lets you:

1. Select a country and year range
2. See CO₂ per capita over time
3. View a data table for the selected subset
